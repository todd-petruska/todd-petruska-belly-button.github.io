Background:  This assignment builds an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. 

Folder contains the following files: 

* index.html 

* samples.json 

* app.js 

The code creates a dashboard by reading in the sample.json from the URL and creating a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found for that specific individual.  It also creates a bubble chart to display samples for the otu_ids, sample_values, and otu_labels.  The sample metadata displays the individualâ€™s demographic information.
